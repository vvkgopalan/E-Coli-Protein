D-xylose transporter: D-xylose is a simple sugar and is use din an absorptiontest in humans to check how well intestines are absorbing   d-xylose. It is performed to diagnose conditions that are present due to malabsorption of sugars. D-xylose is a simple sugar that doesnt need to be broken down. This protein is important as it allows for a transport channel for the D-xylose and is a xylose specific operon that is regulated by genes encoding glucose and mannose uptake. This is found on the xyLE gene and it can help biologists study gene regulation and protein export.
